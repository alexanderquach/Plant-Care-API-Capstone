<h1>Plantcare Tracker!</h1>

Welcome to Plantcare Tracker and Plant Care API!
As a new owner of numerous houseplants, I've gotten to the point where I've started to lose track of care for each of my plants!
I wanted to create a space where I could input care information about my plants to help myself keep track of them, as well as
be able to connect with other plant owners to see and get information about their plants.
